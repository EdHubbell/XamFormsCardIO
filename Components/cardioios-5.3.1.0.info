You will need to pass in an instance of `ICardIOPaymentViewControllerDelegate` to the constructor so you can handle when a card is scanned, or the user has cancelled scanning.\n\n```\n// Create and Show the View Controller\nvar paymentViewController = new CardIOPaymentViewController (this);\n\n// Display the card.io interface\nPresentViewController(paymentViewController, true);\n```\n\nYou can implement `ICardIOPaymentViewControllerDelegate` to capture the results:\n\n```\npublic void UserDidCancelPaymentViewController (CardIOPaymentViewController paymentViewController)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Scanning Canceled!\");\n}\npublic void UserDidProvideCreditCardInfo (CreditCardInfo cardInfo, CardIOPaymentViewController paymentViewController)\n{\n    if (cardInfo == null) {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Scanning Canceled!\");\n    } else {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Card Scanned: \" + cardInfo.CardNumber);\n    }\t\n\n    paymentViewController.DismissViewController(true, null);        \n}\n```\n","Hash":"c2fd165c20397d9486c874871acbd156","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":null}
